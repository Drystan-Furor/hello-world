Driven by the question: What do you want to be able to do or do in the future that you are not yet able to do? I follow goals from my Personal Development Plan such as gaining skills, knowledge, competencies or experience that I need for future positions but not yet fully mastered.

I follow courses and training to further develop my basic skills as a Software Engineer. In addition, I think it is important to have a good work-life balance because I like to spend quality time with my loved ones.
